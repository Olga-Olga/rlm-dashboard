rlm-dashboard
=============

internal purposes dashboard. Seems that is cannot be used anywhere else outside Serena.

1. Install node.js
2. Install and start MongoDB
2. npm install grunt-cli -g
3. npm install bower -g
4. clone repository somewhere, start cmd in that folder
5. npm install
6. bower install
7. grunt

Instead of step #7 you can run "grunt build" and "node server" if you'd like to.
